# AnnealMail

AnnealMail is an experimental, unauthorized fork of Enigmail to use
post-quantum computer encryption in place of GPG/PGP encryption.

In the first stage, you should be able to install AnnealMail as a Thunderbird
plugin, and sign and receive e-mails using CodeCrypt

I may need to write ccr-agent to replace gpg-agent for key management.
